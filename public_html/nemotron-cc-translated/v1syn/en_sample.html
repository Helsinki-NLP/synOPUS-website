&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Whose Culture?&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Karakter admits that he rarely breaks even on these shows, which are mostly attended by backpackers, college kids, and curiosity seekers.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;On a good night, his shows draw a crowd of 200-300 people, which would be disastrous for a South Beach superclub such as Opium Garden.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&quot;On the Masta Killa show [which took place last November 5], we got 350 people there, and three of us that were involved in promoting the show lost about $70 each,&quot; he says.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&quot;Every show I've thrown, it's not like I'm walking away with big bucks and shit,&quot; he continues. &quot;I probably have enough money to eat sushi and smoke a joint.&quot; Why does he promote shows that lose money? &quot;Just for the love of good hip-hop,&quot; he says.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;The artists he brings out are &quot;inspiring and motivating, at least to me.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;REMEMBER THE&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;ELEPHANTS -SAVE&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;THEM!&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Capturing &amp;amp;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Translocating wild elephants!&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;The following pages are dedicated to the late Abd Rahim B Jaleh who was killed by a wild male elephant in 1981 in the course of dutyat an Ayer Hitam sugar cane plantation May Allah SWT bless his soul and the dedicated men &amp;amp; their families of the Elephant Orphanage Sanctuary&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;cleared forests&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;damaged young oil palm tree&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;even electrified fences can't keep them out!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;even deeply dug moats too!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;the ECTU is contacted...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;..and the calls are promptly recorded for action!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The Elephant Capture &amp;amp;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Translocation&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Unit or&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;ECTU was created in&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;1974 to address the problems of wild elephant intrusions into crash crop planted areas owned by individuals, private plantation groups such as IOI Berhad, Guthrie&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;Berhad &amp;amp; semi-government agencies such as FELDA, FELCRA &amp;amp;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;RISDA.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;What used to be their natural habitat had been cleared and replaced with oil palm, rubber, cocoa, watermelons, banana and other crash crops which resulted in a hard-to-resist temptation for the wild elephants to raid these areas during the late evenings and early mornings unchallenged.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;To further protect the elephants, the ECTU has been moving elephants from areas of conflict to permanently protected areas.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;'They never do any harm unless provoked, even though they go about in herds, being of all animals the least solitary in habit.' Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;23&quot;&gt;AD 77&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;24&quot;&gt;In the early days of the unit before&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;25&quot;&gt;1974, the method of eradicating the problem was simply shooting &amp;amp; killing the elephants on sight&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;26&quot;&gt;- until the numbers decreased alarmingly and the unit decided to manage the problem by using a combination of scientific and manual method of translocating the elephants.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Armed with dart guns filled with the Immobilondrug, the rangers would painstakingly track down raiding elephants on foot and&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;4WDs, knock out the intended elephants, secure them to trees using shackles &amp;amp; stainless steel chains and then use the strength of tamed working elephants to drag out their captured wild cousins onto trucks before releasing the problematic elephants to bigger and safer jungle reserves.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;The team also operated on an activity-based approach long before the setting up of Kuala&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Gandah Elephant Conservation Centre.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The men had to camp in areas where there were problems for as quick as 1 month and as long as 2 years in one place where they took turns in taking leave to be with their loved ones.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Instead of using chains, they used jute ropes and used the direct approach in capturing wild elephants - riding on tamed elephants, wading into the wild herds and throwing lassos onto the smallest elephants they could get.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;This method was stopped as it was unsuccessful due to the complications arising from the local terrain and replaced with the method of darting wild elephants with powerful drugs and using tamed elephants to lead and drag lightly sedated wild elephants onto waiting trucks.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;So far, between 300 to 500&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;wild elephants have been removed from their steadily shrinking habitats to their new homes in&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;Taman Negara in Pahang &amp;amp; Terengganu,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Upper Royal Belum&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;38&quot;&gt;ForestsReserve in Perak &amp;amp; Endau-Rompin State Park at the&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;39&quot;&gt;Johore/Pahang borders.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;In the course of these translocation, the unit has suffered one death of its rangers, several seriously injured personnelwhile about 40 wild elephants due to stress since 1978&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;The financial costs, resources &amp;amp;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;42&quot;&gt;manpower required makes the translocation a difficult, dangerous and expensive process.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Any takers out there?&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Wild elephant translocation must be painstakingly prepared&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&amp;amp; executed with expert skills and knowledge.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;46&quot;&gt;One must also have a cool head when a 4 ton giant charges at almost 40kph through the dense jungles!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;47&quot;&gt;In the hot, humid and shady environment, detecting a wild elephant is very difficult and dangerous.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Elephants can be unpredictable ; in particularly a young male elephant may be aggressive and charge in an attempt to exert its authority!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;49&quot;&gt;Immobilon is used to bring down an elephant at a distance of not less than 10 metres&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;; this means the dart man has to skillfully and quietly make his way close to the intended elephant while being protected by two .458 rifle totting colleagues, in case the elephant charges.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Applying Immobilon is itself a highly dangerous work where a drop of this powerful drug can cause a man to gointo coma almost immediately if exposed to an open wound!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;52&quot;&gt;The standard amount used is usually 4cc of Immobilon which should be enough to bring down an adult elephant.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;53&quot;&gt;It usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes for the drug to be effective onto the elephant.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;54&quot;&gt;Once the elephant has been darted, it it usual for the elephant to try and pull out the dart while sending cries of help to its herd.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;55&quot;&gt;This is a most dangerous time when the elephant may charge at full speed.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;56&quot;&gt;All the while, the rifle team is in contact with the 2nd team of chainmen - about 150 metres away - using walkie talkies.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;It is also noted that darting an elephant also depends much on the terrain&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;58&quot;&gt;- swampy areas are a NO&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;59&quot;&gt;GO as the elephant might drown even under a foot of water and the riflemen might also be bogged down in case the elephant makes an about turn and attack the team!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;60&quot;&gt;The area of the hunt should also contain enough big trees to secure the sedated elephant and for the team's protection against attacking elephants.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;61&quot;&gt;All the men are always in jungle camouflaged uniform and wearing laced up jungle boots.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;62&quot;&gt;&quot; You will die a thousand times over and over again &quot;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;63&quot;&gt;when you hear the growling of an enraged wild elephant, not knowing where it is lurking and coming in from the dense and humid green hell!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;64&quot;&gt;Total silence is of upmost priority!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;65&quot;&gt;elephant droppings&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;66&quot;&gt;elephant foot print&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;67&quot;&gt;applying the dangerousImmobilon&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;he's on to it&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;69&quot;&gt;......and down it goes!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;70&quot;&gt;eyes wide shut!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;71&quot;&gt;it's booked and cuffed&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;72&quot;&gt;the team works together to ensure that the chains hold the elephant&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;73&quot;&gt;...while making sure that it's protected from the heat of the sun&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;74&quot;&gt;Once the targetted elephant is darted, it will slowly move away while sounding the alarm bell to the rest of the herd.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;75&quot;&gt;The leader of the herd, which is the matriarch, will always lead the rest of the herd away ensuring that all the smaller elephants are protected all the time.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;76&quot;&gt;The rifle team will slowly followed the trails left by the darted elephant and once found, the 2nd team - the chainmen - will quickly do their job of ;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;77&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;78&quot;&gt;Ensuring that the darted elephant lies down in a correct position where there should not be any protruding rocks or wood against the elephant's side as this will most likely cause both the elephant's lungs to crush the heart.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;79&quot;&gt;Rangers must accurately take note of breathing sounds of the slumped elephant which will determine whether or not the airway is restricted.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;80&quot;&gt;If it is, they will have to apply heart stimulant drug to ensure that the animal will continue breathing normally.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;81&quot;&gt;2.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;82&quot;&gt;In the meantime, the riflemen will stand guard in case the rest of the herd, particularly the young aggressive males, will come charging to protect their darted colleague.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;83&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;84&quot;&gt;The chainmen will quickly secured the front legs of the dartedelephant to a big tree while preparations to revive it will be doneusing a dose of the Revivon drug which will be injected behind theelephant's ears.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;85&quot;&gt;To increase the spread of the reviving drug, flapping of the ears aredone thus speeding up blood circulation.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;86&quot;&gt;rangers stand guard against possible attackes from the herd&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;87&quot;&gt;down but not out!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;88&quot;&gt;Revivon - the reviving drug&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;89&quot;&gt;the hunter becomes the savior&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;90&quot;&gt;wha? wh?&lt;/s&gt;
