Şo duran ýerinde aşak çöküp gyşardy.<br/>
At the place where he stands, he falls down and cries out.
<hr/>
Ine, şol çilik oýnap urşanlaryň biri şu tüýdük çalyp oturan Tarhandy.<br/>

<hr/>
Kämahal bir tilki görünýärdi.<br/>
It was sometimes a language.
<hr/>
Ýöne öz şägirdiniň aty niçik seýislänini bilmek üçin şo toýa Ahal bilen gidipdi. — Meniň göwnüme bolmasa, ol daňdan çapylmadyk ýaly — diýip, halypa seýis aýtdy.<br/>
But he went with Achan to find out his disciples ’ name, and he said: “If I don’t feel like it wasn’t going out of the morning. ”
<hr/>
Ony aňsatlyk bilen beräýmezler.<br/>
It is not easy to give it.
<hr/>
Özi ýaly ýigitleriň köpüsi şeýledi.<br/>
The same was true of many young people like them.
<hr/>
Ýene-de şadyýan şorta sözler aýdyldy.<br/>

<hr/>
Galtamanlar iki atlyny gördüler.<br/>
The galaxies saw two horses.
<hr/>
Serbazlar sizi talap, ýesir alyp gaýdýar.<br/>
The shepherds have demanded and taken you captive.
<hr/>
Onuň entek dyzanagy aýrylmandy.<br/>
He has not yet been hungry.

Bujnurd şerabyny içip, haremhanalarda keýp çekmek üçin Keraly söwdagäriň dükany ýaly dükanyň bolmagy ýeterlik däl.<br/>
It is not enough for us to drink the buzzzurd wine and enjoy chairs, as the merchant’s merchant’s store.

Ahal atyň başyny beýläk sowdy.<br/>
The horse is thrown down.
<hr/>
Şorguýuda çişlig-ä bolardy — diýip yjaza soraýan ähende gürläp, Ahalyň ýüzüne seretdi.<br/>
I'd like to have a club in the newspaper, and she'd look at her face.
<hr/>
Ýüzüne gündogaryň ajaýyp owadan nagyşlary çekilen "Kuranyň" süreleri ýazylan diwarlar diýseň owadandy.<br/>
The walls that were written on the eastern eastern coats were beautiful.
<hr/>

<hr/>
Onuň aman dileýän gözleri gorkudan ýaňa delmirip, özüniň jelladyna seredýärdi.<br/>
His enthusiastic eyes were shouting out of fear, and he looked at his own wounds.
<hr/>
Kä ol badak saldy, kä beýleki içden çilşirdi.<br/>
Suddenly, he ran out of the other way.
<hr/>
Käwagt bir "haw-haw" edip ýaltalyk bilen üýrdüler.<br/>
Sometimes they've changed with an accuracy.
<hr/>
Atyň guýrugyndan aslyşjakdylar, habyrdap hasanaklajakdylar.<br/>
The horse was desperate, and they tried to explore it.
<hr/>
Ol işi edeniňden soňra, toklyny il-gün saňa bagyşlar.<br/>
He will forgive you the whole day after you have done it.
<hr/>
Çepiksi ýigit öýlenende onuň gelni bilen geçiren ilkinji agşamyny diňläpdirler. — "Garadolan pälwany ýykdym" diýip, gelniniň ýanynda öwünýä — diýip, Garamergen aýtdy.<br/>

<hr/>
Ol Ineri gürlemäge goýman: — Gelseň, hoş gelipsiň, guluň ýerini tapdym.<br/>
He did not stop speaking, saying: “Come, please, and I have found your servant’s place.
<hr/>
Yza öwrülip, bir-birine täzeden okdurylan atlar bu gezekki duşuşykda geçip gitmediler.<br/>

They were saddened to hear that they had not been thrown into the trumpets.

“ Absolutely, ” he said.
<hr/>
Ýeri, Şorguýa näme diýersiň?!<br/>
What do you say to the earth, Syria?
<hr/>
Birden üstüne gaýa ýykylana döndi.<br/>
Suddenly, he fell down on the rock.
