On seeing that St.
<hr/>
Mapema ulifuatwa mfano wa Wadominiko wa konventi zote kuwa na magereza, ila yajali utu.<br/>
Earlier followed the example of the Dominicans of all the connventies to have prisons, except that they are concerned about personality.
<hr/>
Baadhi ziligeuka kuwa mashirika ya kitume, bila ya kuacha kanuni ya Kiklara.<br/>
Some turned into professional organizations, leaving the Clara principle behind.

Babu bora wa Kanisa lote, mt.<br/>
The best grandfather of the whole Church, knack.
<hr/>
Ili kurekebisha maisha ya mapadri, toka zamani ulisisitizwa uundaji wa jumuia kati yao, ambamo waishi na kusali na kufanya utume kwa pamoja.<br/>
To reform the life of priests, it has long been emphasized the creation of a community among them, where they live and pray and perform a mission together.
<hr/>
Katika karne ya XVII na XVIII hata Waurbani wakapata marekebisho yao hasa upande wa ufukara, Ufaransa na Italia.<br/>
In the 16th and XVII centuries, even the Puritans found their own reforms, largely on the part of poverty, France, and Italy.

<hr/>
Halikukosekana taji la ushahidi wa imani na wa ubikira (Waklara wote wa Tripoli mwaka 1289, na wote 70 wa Tolemais mwaka 1291).<br/>
There was no lack of a crown of witness of faith and virginity (all of the Croatians of Tripoli in 1289, and all 70 of Tolemais in 1291).

<hr/>
Kwa kuwa Yohane XXIII alifariki tarehe 2-6-1963, vikao vitatu vya mwisho viliongozwa na mwandamizi wake, Paulo VI, na hati zote kumi na sita zikatolewa chini yake pia kwa kupigiwa kura ya ndiyo karibu kwa kauli moja.<br/>
As Johnane XXIII passed away on 2-6-1963, the last three seats were led by his successor, Paul VI, and all sixteen documents were also released under him for a nearly equal vote.
<hr/>
Hoja ya msingi ilikuwa kwamba walio wengi wasingefanya bidii katika sala ya binafsi.<br/>
The basic point was that the majority would not be zealous in personal prayer.
<hr/>
Miaka ya kukaa nje ya konventi ndiyo miaka ambapo mashirika mengi ya huduma yalianzishwa na watawa hao.<br/>
The years during the excursion of the konvent are the years when many ministerial agencies were formed by the nuns.
<hr/>
Baada ya Ukomunisti kuanguka (1989) matawi yote yamejitahidi kujiimarisha Ulaya Mashariki walipopata tena nafasi ya kuhubiri na kupokea miito, ambayo huko ni mingi.<br/>
After the fall of Communism (1989) all branches have made efforts to strengthen themselves in Eastern Europe when they once again had the opportunity to preach and receive calls, which are many there.
<hr/>
Tena udugu haukuishia shirikani bali ulitakiwa kuenea kwa watu na viumbe vyote.<br/>
Again the brotherhood did not end in an organization but was required to spread to all people and creatures.
<hr/>
Ndivyo walivyofanya watawa wa mashirika mbalimbali, kwa kuwa haja ya urekebisho ilitambulikana na wote katika Kanisa la karne ya XV na ya XVI.<br/>
So did the monks of various organizations, since the need for reform was recognized by all in the XV - and XVI - century Church.
<hr/>
Polepole karama ya mwanzilishi na ya kila tawi ikaja kuzingatiwa tena kwa furaha, badala ya kujali masuala ya miundo tu.<br/>
Slowly the gift of the founder and of each branch became the focus of joy, not solely on design issues.
<hr/>
Hata vita viliwapa nafasi za kujitoa kwa upendo kama mapadri wa wanajeshi, hasa katika kuzuia Waturuki Waislamu wasiteke Ulaya nzima kati ya mwaka 1571 na 1686.<br/>
Wars even gave them opportunities to give of themselves as lovingly as military priests, especially in the prevention of Muslim Turks from whole Europe between 1571 and 1686.
<hr/>
Hata desturi ya Wakonventuali ya kupokea watoto ikaja kwisha karne ya XVI.<br/>
Even the custom of the Konventual child - receiving movement came to an end in the 16th century.
<hr/>
Kama yeye alitaka mafungamano imara na Utawa I, monasteri zote zikiwa chini ya Ndugu Wadogo, na wanne kati yao wakiwa tayari kuihudumia kila mojawapo.<br/>
If he wanted strong ties with Ultimate I, all the visitant under a Small Brother, and four of them ready to serve each one.
<hr/>
Hivyo kwa kutofautisha kutumia vitu na kuvimiliki kisheria, Ndugu Wadogo waliweza kujidai fukara ingawa wanatumia vingi, eti si vya kwao!<br/>
So by contrasting the use of things and legal property, Little Brothers were able to fend for themselves even though they were using a lot, not a local one!
<hr/>
SALA YA MOYO INANITAKASA Nimeathiriwa na vilema mbalimbali, kiasi kwamba matendo mema pia yamejaa umimi, kiburi, majivuno n.k.<br/>
THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT I am affected by various disabilities, so that good deeds are also full of self - pride, pride, pride, etc.

Pius X (1903-1914) akatamka kwamba, "Watumishi wakuu wa familia tatu za Kifransisko wako sawa kwa heshima na mamlaka walizonazo, nao watazamwe sawia kama makamu na waandamizi halisi wa Mt.<br/>
Pius X (1903-1914) said, "The chief servants of three Franksisco families are equal to the honors and authorities they have, and they will be held in position as a vice and the real successors of St.
<hr/>
Mpaka leo kanuni zake zinaongoza karibu wamonaki wote wa Mashariki, na kwa njia yao makanisa ya Orthodoksi kwa kuwa maaskofu kwanza ni wamonaki nao wanaelekeza wakristo wote kufuata mifano yao.<br/>
To this day its principles guide nearly all Eastern monks, and by means of them Orthodox churches as the first bishops are monks and direct all Christians to follow their image.
<hr/>
Kazi ya kawaida zaidi ilikuwa ile ya kuhubiri.<br/>
The most common was the preaching work.
<hr/>
Pamoja na hayo, yalianzishwa mashirika mapya ya kiume Hispania, Ufaransa na hata Gwatemala kwa ajili ya huduma mbalimbali.<br/>
In addition, new male organizations were formed in Spain, France, and even Gwatemala for services.
<hr/>
Bila ya kutembelea kanda za shirika, alishika uongozi wote mikononi mwake, akichagua Watumishi na walinzi, akihamisha ndugu, akituma wawakilishi wake huko na huko kusimamia kazi ya Watumishi, na akikataa kuitisha mkutano mkuu.<br/>
Without visiting association zones, he took full control of his hand, appointing servants and guards, transfering a brother, sending his representatives there and there to supervise the work of the Servants, and refusing to threaten the principal assembly.
<hr/>
Upande wa Waklara alirekebisha au kuanzisha monasteri 22 kufuatana na kanuni ya I aliyoomba nakala yake halisi kwa monasteri mama ya Asizi.<br/>
On the side of Waklara he corrected or established 22 seesters in harmony with I principle he asked for a copy of his true copy to the mother of Asizi.

Lakini Benedikto XV (1914-1922), baada ya kuona TOR inameza mashirika madogo ya Watersyari, aliiruhusu tena (1921) akipendekeza mashirika yote ya kiume na ya kike ya Utawa III wa Kifransisko yaungane nayo.<br/>
But Benedikto XV (1914-1922), after seeing the rat swallowing small Watersyari organizations, he allowed it again (1921) in favor of all Ufransisko’s male and female alliances.
<hr/>
Hata karne ya XVI ilidai sana urekebisho wa Kanisa lote.<br/>
Even the 16th century was a serious demand for reform for the whole Church.
<hr/>
MAREKEBISHO KUANZA (1400-1517) Karne ya XV hadi ya XVIII ziliona monasteri za Waklara kuhuishwa tena, kufuatana na marekebisho ya Ndugu Wadogo (kama ilivyotokea kwa wanawake wa mashirika mengine), halafu na Mtaguso wa Trento na maagizo ya Mapapa, lakini pia kutokana na karama yenyewe ya Mt.<br/>
The XVII century saw Chelassteries resuscitated, following the reforms of the Small Brethren (such as the women of other corporations), then by Trento’s club and papal orders, but also as a result of St.

One of them read Mass in front of the king of Congo (1491) and baptized him (1495).
<hr/>
Zaidi ya mashirika 2000 yaliyoanzishwa baada ya hapo, hasa katika karne ya XIX, yalifuata kwa kiasi fulani mtindo huo, yakilenga hasa huduma fulani iliyoonekana inahitajika lakini haina wa kuitoa, k.mf. kuhubiri vijijini, kulea vijana, kufundisha fukara, kuuguza wagonjwa, kuanzisha misheni, kushughulikia upashanaji habari.<br/>
More than 2,000 organizations founded after that, especially in the XIX century, adopted the style to some extent, targeting a seemingly necessary service but not available to provide it, kmf. to preach in rural areas, to raise young ones, to teach furahs, to nurse patients, to set up missions, to handle communication.
<hr/>
Baada ya kujitayarisha, nifanye nini? 5.1.<br/>
What will I do after I prepare?
<hr/>
Miaka ishirini baada ya mtaguso kumalizika, sinodi maalumu iliyoitishwa ili kutathmini matokeo yake ilisema wazi kuwa kazi bado sana, kwa namna ya pekee kuhusu kulenga utakatifu kwa waamini wote.<br/>
Twenty years after the trip was over, a special synod attached to assessing its results made it clear that work is still hard, in a special way about aiming holiness for all believers.
<hr/>
Sala yenyewe mawazo mafupi ya imani kwa kutumia pengine kitabu mapenzi, yaani unyenyekevu, tumaini, upendo, sikitiko n.k. maombi: ya mwanga, ya kudumu mpaka mwisho na hasa ya kujaa upendo c.<br/>
Prayer itself is short thoughts of faith under perhaps the love book, namely humility, hope, love, pity .k. applications: of light, permanence to the end and particularly of love c.
<hr/>
Baada ya Wafransisko 354 wa Utawa I na III kufia dini, waamini wakaendelea kwa siri bila ya mapadri: wamisionari wapya walipofika (1865) wakakuta Wakristo wenye majina ya Kifransisko!<br/>
After the 354 Franksisco I and III martyred, believers secretly continued without priests: When the new missionaries arrived in (1865) they found Christians with Fransisco!
<hr/>
Nyumba za kitawa katika eneo hilo lote likafikia kuzidi 50, baadhi zikiwa na ndugu wasiopungua 20.<br/>
The farmhouses throughout the region reached over 50, some of them with fewer than 20 brothers.
<hr/>
Pamoja na kuhubiri, wengine wametuachia kwa maandishi hotuba zao, mifano mingi na maelekezo juu ya namna ya kuhubiri.<br/>
In addition to preaching, others have written their talks, illustrations, and instructions on how to preach.
<hr/>
Falsafa ya Wafransisko ilifuata ile ya Plato kumpitia Mt.<br/>
The philosophy of the Franksisco followed Plato’s review of St.
<hr/>

<hr/>
Walifuata kanuni ya mt.<br/>
They applied the principle of a palm tree.
<hr/>
Mojawapo ni tunda la Maria Klara Bouillevaux (+1871) aliyelianzisha Paris (1854), likifuata kanuni ya Utawa Hasa III na katiba maalumu, yenye jambo la pekee la kuabudu ekaristi saa zote.<br/>
One is Maria Klara Bouillevaux’s fruit (+1871) who established Paris (1854), following the principle of Ultimate III and the official constitution, which has something special to worship at all hours.
<hr/>
Hatimaye yalijikuta mali zake zimepungua sana, na wanashirika vilevile, lakini waliobaki wametakaswa kiasi kikubwa.<br/>
Eventually they found that his possessions were greatly reduced, and they share, but the rest have been greatly cleansed.
<hr/>
Hata ndani ya Kanisa wengi wamesoma hati zake kijuujuu, wakishikilia upande mmoja na kutojali wa pili.<br/>
Even inside the Church many have read its manuscripts superficially, clinging to one side and taking no note of the second.
<hr/>
Lengo la sala hiyo ni "kuongea moyo kwa moyo" (mt.<br/>
The goal of the prayer is to “speak heartily” (mt.
<hr/>
Wakonventuali wasishiriki tena uchaguzi wa Mtumishi mkuu, wala kiongozi wao asiitwe Mtumishi bali Mwalimu mkuu tu!<br/>
Konventuals should no longer share the main Servant’s election, nor should their leader be called Servant but the Great Teacher!
<hr/>
Pia mikutano mikuu haikufanyika muda mrefu: katika OFM tangu 1768 hadi 1856; kwa Wakonventuali tangu 1789 hadi 1847.<br/>
The principal meetings were also not held long: in the OFM from 1768 to 1856; to the Konventuli from 1789 to 1847.
<hr/>
KUANDIKA Kabla sijafunga sala ni vema niandike chochote: muhtasari wake au neno nililolitafakari au sala iliyochipuka moyoni mwangu au azimio nililolifikia au wazo fulani ambalo linaweza kunisaidia hapo baadaye.<br/>
WRITING before I say a prayer is good for me to write anything: its summary or word that I meditated on or a prayer that sprouted in my heart or a certain resolution that I came up with or a thought that might help me later on.
<hr/>
Hivyo ni vigumu kufanikisha mtaguso.<br/>
Thus, touch is a challenge.
<hr/>
Mambo hayo yalipotokana na msimamo wa moyo yalijenga kweli, tofauti na yalipofanyika kwa nje tu.<br/>
These events were the result of a heart - to - heart stand that built up the truth, unlike their outward appearance.
<hr/>
Basi, anajaribu kwa kila namna kunikatisha tamaa nisisali.<br/>
So in every way he tries to discourage me from praying.
<hr/>
Utawa II hauna mwakilishi, kutokana na muundo wake wa monasteri zenye ugo.<br/>
Nuns II does not have a representative, as a result of its rustic appearance.
<hr/>
Jumuia kubwa zaidi zilikuwa zile za kutolea huduma fulani, hasa kutunza wagonjwa.<br/>
Larger numbers were those for service, especially care for the sick.
<hr/>
Kuhusu uenezaji Injili kwa wasio Wakristo, karne ya XVI na XVII zilikuwa na miito mingi ya kimisionari, hata likatokea swali, "Je, Watumishi wanaweza kuzuia watawa wasiende kwenye nchi za misheni?".<br/>

UNYENYEKEVU "Sala ya mnyenyekevu hupenya mawingu".<br/>
HUMILY "Perfect prayer penetrates the clouds".
<hr/>
Monasteri nyingine zikaanzishwa karne hiyohiyo Peruu, Ekwado, Kolombia, Chile, Gwatemala na Brazili.<br/>
Other Indonesians were established that same century in Peru, Ekwado, Colombia, Chile, Gwatemala, and Brazil.
<hr/>
Polepole Kanisa likawakubalia (1950) wito mpya wa mashirika ya ulimwenguni ambayo waamini wanawekwa wakfu wawe chumvi, mwanga na chachu kati ya watu.<br/>
The Church gradually adopted (1950) a new call for world organizations to which believers are dedicated to salt, light, and leaven.
<hr/>
"Kabla ya yote katika kutafakari kwangu natumia Injili: ndani yake naona yale yote ambayo roho yangu maskini ndogo inayahitaji.<br/>
"Before all in my meditation I use the Gospel: into it I see all that my little spirit needs.
<hr/>
Wiliamu wa Ockham (+1347) aliyepotosha falsafa akadai eti, akili haiwezi kujua yanayopita malimwengu: msimamo wake ukaenea sana, ukampa Martin Luther silaha dhidi ya imani katoliki, ukaathiri utamaduni wa Magharibi hadi leo.<br/>
Ockham (+1347) a perverted philosophy claimed that the mind cannot know what is beyond the world: its position became widespread, gave Martin Luther arms against the Catholic faith, and affected Western culture to this day.
<hr/>
Mwaka 1680 kwa wastani kulikuwa na ndugu 17 kwa nyumba; mwaka 1762 walifikia 20.<br/>
In 1680 the average was 17 brothers from house to house; in 1762 they reached 20.
<hr/>
Fransisko, kwa jinsi alivyoathiriwa na roho hiyo.<br/>
Francisco, by the way he was affected by that spirit.
<hr/>
Hata hivyo baadhi yao waliongoza vizuri na kuchangia amani ya Kanisa hadi ulipopatikana umoja wake na wa shirika mwaka 1418.<br/>
However, some took the lead and promoted the peace of the Church until its unity with the corporation was achieved in 1418.
<hr/>
Jubilei ya miaka 700 tangu shirika lianze (1909), iliadhimishwa kwa fahari zaidi, kutokana na hali ya kutumainisha ya matawi yote.<br/>
Seventy - seven years after the start of the association (1909), it was observed more proudly, thanks to the trusting condition of all branches.
<hr/>
Veronika Giuliani (+1727) aliyejaa karama na njozi tangu utotoni, alivyosimulia kwa utiifu na unyofu katika shajara yenye kurasa 22,000.<br/>
Veronika Giuliani (+1727) who has been full of cards and visions since childhood, she related obediently and honestly in a 22,000 - page store.
<hr/>
Hata hivyo uwepo wake umekuwa changamoto kwa matawi makubwa ambayo yakaanza kujirudi kidogo, baada ya kupungukiwa na wengi wasiokuwa na msimamo pamoja na kutambua matokeo ya majaribio yaliyofanywa; shida ni kwamba kujirekebisha baada ya kulegea sana si rahisi, hasa kama kazi hiyo inahusu idadi kubwa ya watu.<br/>
His presence, however, has been a challenge to large branches that began to return a bit, after the failure of many non-consistency and the realization of the experimental results; the crisis is that recuperating after becoming very loose is not easy, especially if the work has to do with a large number of people.
<hr/>
Ndugu Wadogo wakajiona kuwa shirika hilo jipya ambalo lilete Kanisa la Kiroho lenye kufuata ufukara.<br/>
The Small Brethren considered themselves to be this new organization in which the spiritual charismatic Church finds itself.
<hr/>
Hivyo upendo pia unakua kwa kutaka zaidi nilingane na matakwa yake.<br/>
So love also grows by wanting me more to measure up to his requirements.
<hr/>
Karibu na monasteri za kiume kuliko na nyingine za kike.<br/>
Close to male seeingsters than to female counterparts.
<hr/>
MBONA SINA MOYO HUO?<br/>
WHY NOT THEIR HEART?
<hr/>
Hapo wakasisitiza ndugu wasisome kwa ajili ya elimu, bali kwa kujirekebisha na kurekebisha wengine.<br/>
There they insisted on not reading for an education but, rather, by adjusting and correcting others.
<hr/>
Kwa ajili hiyo aliilinganisha TOR na matawi matatu ya Utawa I: tangu hapo familia ya Kifransisko ikahesabiwa kuwa na Wakuu 4.<br/>
For this he compared the Mix to three branches of Monks I: since then the Franksisco family was counted as 4.
<hr/>
Mara nyingine Wakonventuali walipokea makundi hayo chini ya ulinzi wao ili kuwakomoa Waoservanti waliokuwa wanawadharau wakijidai ndio wafuasi halisi wa Mt.<br/>
The Konventuals sometimes received the congregations under their protection in order to bring down the self - exacting people of St.
<hr/>
Kumbe kabla ya hapo Tertius Ordo ilimaanisha kundi la tatu la waamini, yaani walei, waliopangwa baada ya makleri na watawa.<br/>
Tertius Ordo had previously referred to the third group of believers, the monastics, who were organized after the colporteurs and nuns.
<hr/>
Upinzani wa Maaskofu na maparoko dhidi ya Ndugu Wadogo ulikuwa umeungwa mkono na chuo kikuu cha Paris: hapo hazikupingwa tu ruhusa kadhaa walizopewa, bali msingi wenyewe wa mtindo wao na wa Wadominiko.<br/>
The opposition of the Bishops and the pastors against the Minor brothers had been backed up by the Paris University: it was then not restricted to a number of permissions given to them, but the very foundation of their style and of the Dominicans.
<hr/>
Hiyo ni sheria hasa yenye namba 39.<br/>
It is essentially a law of 39.
<hr/>
Kutokana na kujitegemea kwa kila monasteri, Wabenedikto wakapata sura tofautitofauti bila ya kuachana na kanuni.<br/>
As a result of the independence of each observer, the Benediktos received a different chapter without leaving the rules.
<hr/>
Kusema niseme kwa moyo hata nikitumia sala za mwingine: kama maneno yake hayalingani na moyo wangu itakuwa kazi bure.<br/>
Saying with heartfelt expression even using the prayers of another: If his words do not compare with my heart, it will be in vain.
<hr/>
Mtumishi wa kanda aliwatafuta sana, lakini walilindwa vizuri na Katerina Cibo, ndugu wa Papa.<br/>
A zone servant looked for them, but they were well protected by the Pope’s brother Katerina Cibo.
<hr/>
Watawa waliozoea kwa miaka kadhaa kuishi mmojammoja ulimwenguni, walipolazimishwa na Kanisa kurudi konventini hawakukubali tena nidhamu ya nadhiri.<br/>
The nuns, accustomed to living one another in the world for years, were forced by the Church to return to the connventines, no longer accepting the discipline of vows.
<hr/>
Karne ya kwanza ilizaa watakatifu 4 (Klara na Agnes wa Asizi, Agnes wa Praha na Kinga wa Hungaria) na wenye heri 6 katika nchi mbalimbali, hasa kutoka koo za kifalme.<br/>
The first century gave birth to 4 saints (Clara and Agnes of Asizi, Agnes of Praha and King of Hungary) and 6 blessed ones in various lands, mostly from the royal throats.
<hr/>
Mtindo wake ulisisitiza ushirikiano kati ya ndugu kuliko uongozi wa abati na miundo mikubwa.<br/>
His style emphasized cooperation between brothers rather than the leadership of tin and the larger structures.
<hr/>
Vinsenti wa Paulo).<br/>
Vinsenti of Paul).
<hr/>
Kazi hiyo ilichukua miaka mingi kuliko ilivyotarajiwa, kwa kufikiria upya vipengele vyote vya maisha ya Kifransisko.<br/>
It took more years than expected, with all the twilights offransisko’s life being reviewed.
<hr/>
MTAGUSO II WA VATIKANO Muda mfupi baada ya kuchaguliwa papa mwenye heri Yohane XXIII alitangaza uamuzi wake wa kuitisha mtaguso mkuu akiamini kwamba utaweza kuandaa na kusababisha ustawi mpya wa maisha ya Kanisa.<br/>
THE FACTOR II, shortly after being elected the happy pope Yohane XXIIII, announced his decision to scare the main attention in the belief that you will be able to provide and lead to a new interest in Church life.
<hr/>
Baadaye ikatokea migawanyiko mingine kati ya waliopewa na wasiopewa fadhili, yaani ruhusa za pekee.<br/>
Later other divisions were formed between them and the unkind, special permissions.
<hr/>
Upinzani ukalipuka hasa baada ya Nikola III (1277-1280) kutoa hati nyingine juu ya kanuni (1279) ili kuwaondolea Ndugu Wadogo wasiwasi wowote kuhusu namna ya kuitekeleza, pamoja na kuwatetea dhidi ya maadui wa nje.<br/>
Opposition erupted especially after Nikola III (1277-1280) issued another document on the principle (1279) to rid the Small Brethren of any concern about how to implement it, including defending them against outside enemies.
<hr/>
Inafaa niongee nao hasa mwanzoni mwa sala ya moyo ili waniongoze.<br/>
I do well to approach them, especially at the beginning of a heartfelt prayer, so that they can guide me.
<hr/>
SALA YA MOYO INAIMARISHA MAISHA YANGU YA KIROHO Tofauti na wanyama, mimi kama binadamu natakiwa kuishi sio kimwili tu, bali hasa kiroho: yaani sio tu kwa ajili ya kula na kunywa, kuzaa na kustarehe, bali hasa kwa kushirikiana na Mungu na pia na watu, kwa njia ya upendo.<br/>
THE HEART PRAYER IS MAKING MY SPIRITUAL LIFE, I as a human should live not only physically but especially spiritually: that is, not just for eating and drinking, giving birth and relaxation, but especially for associating with God and with people, in a loving way.
<hr/>
Ufransisko ulilingana kikamilifu na madai ya urekebisho ya walei, pia uliwapendeza viongozi wa Kanisa walioona ulivyookoa utiifu wa watu kwao: hivyo ulienea kasi ajabu, hata kati ya wanawake na watu wa ndoa.<br/>
Infransisko was perfectly consistent with the demands of rehabilitation, also of interest to Church leaders who observed it saved people’s obedience to them: thus it spread rapidly, even between women and married people.
<hr/>
Halafu, akiona maisha yao hayana toba na nidhamu za kutosha, ingawa Kardinali mlinzi alijitahidi, aliwaweka wote, wanaume kwa wanawake, chini ya Waoservanti (1567-1568).<br/>
Then, seeing their lives are less repentant and less disciplined, although Cardinal the guardian tried, put them all, men and women, under the Waldensian (1567-1568).
<hr/>
"Nzi anayetaka kuonja utamu wa asali akizamisha mabawa yake ndani ya asali hawezi kuruka tena.<br/>
"The fly that wants to taste the sweetness of honey if it sinks its wings into honey cannot fly again.
<hr/>
Vivyo hivyo, nikiwa na maombi, niyatoe, mradi niweke mbele mapenzi yake.<br/>
Similarly, with my prayers, give them, provided I put them ahead of his will.
<hr/>
Kwa wanovisi Klementi VIII (1592-1605) aliagiza (1596) zichaguliwe tu nyumba ambapo maisha ya kitawa yanashikwa kikamilifu; tena watengewe sehemu maalumu na kuwasiliana na mlezi wao na msaidizi wake tu, pamoja na kushiriki ratiba ya jumuia (sala, milo n.k.).<br/>
For the novis Klementi VIII (1592-1605) he ordered that (1596) be designated houses where monastic life is being taken to the full; and that they should be organized and communicated only with their nurse and his assistant, as well as with a social program (sala, meals etc.).
<hr/>
Hata hivyo wakaendelea kushika kanuni ya TOR na pengine kufundisha.<br/>
Yet they continued to adhere to the legal code and perhaps to teach.
