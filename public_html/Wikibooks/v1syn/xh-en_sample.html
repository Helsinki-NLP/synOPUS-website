Kwahlwa, kwasa: yangumhla wesihlanu.<br/>
It was evening and morning, the fifth day.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo isibhakabhaka ngamazulu.<br/>
God referred to the heavens as heaven.
<hr/>
Wabasikelela uThixo, wathi kubo uThixo, Qhamani, nande, niwuzalise umhlaba niweyise; nibe nobukhosi ezintlanzini zolwandle, nasezintakeni zezulu, nasezintweni zonke eziphilileyo ezinambuzelayo emhlabeni.<br/>
God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over every living creature that creeps on the earth."
<hr/>
Kwahlwa, kwasa: yangumhla wesithandathu.<br/>
It was evening and morning, the sixth day.
<hr/>
Akubon ukuba uyazicinga ezi zinto, naso isithunywa seNkosi sibonakala kuye ephupheni, sisithi, Yosefu, nyana kaDavide, musa ukoyika ukumthabathela kuwe uMariya, umfazi wakho; kuba oko kukhawulweyo phakathi kwakhe kungoMoya oyiNgcwele.<br/>
But when he saw that he thought these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Makubekho izikhanyiso esibhakabhakeni samazulu, zibe ngumahlulo wokwahlula imini kubusuku; zibe zezemiqondiso, zibe zezamaxesha amisiweyo, zibe zezemihla neminyaka; mazibe zizikhanyiso esibhakabhakeni samazulu, zikhanyise ehlabathini.<br/>
God said, "Let there be lights in the sky of the sky for a division of the day by night, for signs, for seasons, for days, and for years. Let them be light in the sky, and light on the earth."
<hr/>
Uya kuzala unyana ke, umbize ngegama elinguYesu; kuba yena eya kubasindisa abantu bakhe ezonweni zabo.<br/>
She will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
<hr/>
Ke kaloku ukuzalwa kukaYesu Kristu kwaye kungolu hlobo: Kwathi, akubon ukuba unina uMariya useleganelwe uYosefu, bengekahlangani, wafunyanwa emithi ngoMoya oyiNgcwele.<br/>
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was done in this way. It happened, when he saw that his mother, Mary, was laid before Joseph, before they were gathered together, that she was found among the trees of the Holy Spirit.
<hr/>
Kwahlwa, kwasa: yangumhla wesibini.<br/>
It was evening and morning, the second day.
<hr/>
Wazisikelela uThixo, esithi, Qhamani, nande, niwazalise amanzi aselwandle; zithi iintaka zande ehlabathini.<br/>
God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea. The birds grow in abundance on the earth."
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Umhlaba mawuphume imiphefumlo ephilileyo ngohlobo lwayo: izinto ezizitho zine, nezinambuzane, nezinto eziphilileyo zomhlaba ngohlobo lwazo.<br/>
God said, "Let the earth bring forth living souls according to its kind, animals, insects, and the living things of the earth according to their kinds."
<hr/>
Ke ehlabathini kwakusenyanyeni, kuselubala; kwakumnyama phezu kwamanzi enzonzobila.<br/>
Now the earth was in the midst of the plain, and there was darkness upon the waters of the deep.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo okomileyo ngumhlaba, wathi intlanganisela yamanzi ziilwandle.<br/>
God called the dry land the earth, and called the gathering of the waters the seas.
<hr/>
Incwadi yomlibo wokuzalwa kukaYesu Kristu, unyana kaDavide, unyana ka-Abraham.<br/>
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ , the son of David, the son of Abraham.
<hr/>
Wasenza uThixo isibhakabhaka, wawahlula amanzi angaphantsi kwesibhakabhaka kuwo amanzi angaphezu kwesibhakabhaka.<br/>
God made the sky, and divided the waters under the sky from which the waters were above.
<hr/>
Zonke izizukulwana ngoko, ezithabathela kuAbraham zizise kuDavide, zizizukulwana ezilishumi elinazine; nezithabathela kuDavide zizise ekufuduselweni kwabo eBhabhilon, zizizukulwana ezilishumi elinazine; nezithabathela ekufuduselweni kwabo eBhabhilon zizise kuKristu, zizizukulwana ezilishumi elinazine.<br/>
All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from their exile to the Christ, fourteen generations.
<hr/>
Kwaba njalo.<br/>
So it proved to be.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Umhlaba mawuphume uhlaza, imifuno evelisa imbewu, imithi yeziqhamo, eyenza iziqhamo ngohlobo lwayo, embewu ikuyo, emhlabeni.<br/>
And God said, Let the earth grow green, and the plants that bring forth seed, and the fruit trees, which bring forth fruit after their kind, which the seed is in the earth.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Amanzi angaphantsi kwamazulu makahlanganiselwe ndaweni-nye, kubonakale okomileyo.<br/>
God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear."
<hr/>
Kwabakho ke ukukhanya.<br/>
Then came the light.
<hr/>
Wamdala ke uThixo umntu ngokomfanekiselo wakhe; wamdala ngokomfanekiselo kaThixo; wadala indoda nenkazana.<br/>
And God created man in his image, and created him in the image of God; male and female he created them.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Yabonani, ndininikile yonke imifuno evelisa imbewu, esemhlabeni wonke, nayo yonke imithi eneziqhamo zemithi evelisa imbewu: yoba kukudla kuni.<br/>
And God said, Behold, I have given unto you every herb that beareth seed in all the earth, and every tree that bringeth forth fruit: it shall be to you for food.
<hr/>
Mababe nobukhosi ezintlanzini zolwandle, nasezintakeni zezulu, nasezintweni ezizitho zine, nasemhlabeni wonke, nasezinambuzaneni zonke ezinambuzela emhlabeni.<br/>
Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the animals, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Amanzi la makanyakazele inyakanyaka, imiphefumlo ephilileyo; zithi neentaka ziphaphazele ehlabathini, esibhakabhakeni sezulu.<br/>
God said, "Let the waters flow into the cloud, the living souls; and let the birds fly over the earth into the sky."
<hr/>
Kwahlwa kwasa: yangumhla wesithathu.<br/>
It was evening and morning, and it was the third day.
<hr/>
Kwahlwa, kwasa: yangumhla wesine.<br/>
It was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo, Makubekho isibhakabhaka phakathi kwawo amanzi, sibe ngumahlulo wokwahlula amanzi kumanzi.<br/>
God said, "Let there be the heavens between the waters, and let them divide the waters from the waters."
<hr/>
Wathi uThixo ukukhanya yimini, wathi ubumnyama bubusuku.<br/>
And God said, The light is the day, and the darkness is the night.
<hr/>
Wenza uThixo izikhanyiso ezikhulu zazibini, esona sikhulu isikhanyiso ukuba silawule imini, esona sincinane isikhanyiso ukuba silawule ubusuku; wenza neenkwenkwezi.<br/>
God made two great lights, the greatest of which is to rule the day, the least of which is to rule the night; and he made the stars.
<hr/>
Nezinto zonke eziphilileyo zomhlaba, neentaka zonke zezulu, nezinambuzane zonke ezisemhlabeni, ezinomphefumlo ophilileyo, ndizinike yonke imifuno eluhlaza ukuba ibe kukudla.<br/>

It was evening and morning, the first day.
<hr/>
Wabona uThixo ukuba kulungile.<br/>
God saw that it was good.
<hr/>
Ke kaloku oku konke kwenzeke, ukuze kuzaliseke okwathethwayo yiNkosi ngomprofeti, isithi, Yabonani, intombi le iya kumitha izale unyana, Bambize ngegama elinguImanuweli, oko kukuthi ngentetho evakalayo, uThixo unathi.<br/>
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Behold, the damsel shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel: that is, God is with us in a loud voice.
<hr/>
Wathi ke uYosefu, evukile ebuthongweni, wenza ngoko besimmisele ngako isithunywa seNkosi, wamthabathela kuye umfazi wakhe; waza ke akamazi, wada wazala unyana wakhe wamazibulo; wambiza ke ngegama elinguYesu.<br/>
Then Joseph arose from sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had appointed him, and took unto him his wife: and he knew her not till she had borne her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.

Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public spectacle, thought she was naked.

The earth came forth green grass, and vegetation that produced seed according to its kind, and trees that produced fruit in it, according to its kind.
