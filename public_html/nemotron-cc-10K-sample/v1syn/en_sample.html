&lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;They were very sweet and accommodating.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Our only problem was with the bathroom.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;They have old plumbing that doesn't work well, so there were a lot of rules but even then things broke and water poured into the restaurant below.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;25&quot;&gt;City House, Rome&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;26&quot;&gt;Excellent4.0 / 5&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Excellent Central Location!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;no elevator up the stairs.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Breakfast was the same thing every morning (yogurt, croissant and Melba toast and juice/coffee/tea).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Still, I loved this place and would stay here in a heartbeat.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The location is just outside the Pantheon, and walking distance to the Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, Vatican, etc.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Being right in the middle of the heart of the city was wonderful!&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Don't even think about driving a car in the city.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;The whole downtown is a ZTL (limited traffic zone), so take the hotel up on their offer to arrange a shuttle that picks you up and drops you off at the doorstep.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;The price is regulated by the city and is the same as a taxi, which at the time of this review was 48 Euro.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;It was money well spent.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;37&quot;&gt;As I said, this is not a conventional hotel, but we loved our stay here, and if I'm ever in Rome again, I will definitely stay here.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;ALBERT SCHWEITZER Biography - Theater, Opera and Movie personalities&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Albert Schweitzer (January 14, 1875-September 4, 1965) entered into his intensive theological studies in 1893 at the University of Strasbourg where he obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1899.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;He began preaching at St.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Nicholas Church in Strasbourg in 1899; he served in various high ranking administrative posts from 1901 to 1912 in the Theological College of St.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Thomas, the college he had attended at the University of Strasbourg.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;In 1906 he published the Quest of the Historical Jesus, a book on which muich of his fame as a theological scholear rests.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;From his professional engagements he earned funds for his education, particularly his later madical schooling, and for his african hospital.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Having decided to go to Africa as a medical missionary rather than as a pastor, Schweitzer in 1905 began the study of medicine at the University of Strasbourg.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;In 1913, having obtained his M.D. degree.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;But in 1917 he and his wife were sent to a French internment camp as prisoners of war.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Released in 1918, Schweitzer spent the next six years in Europe.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Schweitzer returned to Lambarene in 1924 and except for relatively short periods of time, spent the remainder of his life there.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;With the funds earned from his own royalties and personal appearance fees and with those donaed from all parts of the world, he expanded the hospital to seventy buildings which by the early 1960's could take care of over 500 patients in residence at any one time.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;At Lambarene, Schweitzer was doctor and surgeon in the hospital, pastor of a congregation, administrator in the hospital, pastor of congregation, administrator of a village, superintendent of buildings and grounds, writer of scholarly books, commentator on contemporary history, musician, host to countless visitors.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;The honours he recei8ved were numerous, including the Goethe Prize of Frankfurt and honorary doctorates from many universities emphasizing one of another of his achievem ents.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;The Nobel Peace Prize for 1952, hav ing been withheld in that yaar, was given to him on December 10, 1953.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;With the $33,000 prize money, he started the leprosarium at Lambarene.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;11 Year Old Devout Athiest&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;My 11 year old daughter has just gotten a Facebook page (I know I know 13 is the age limit.) and she`s been having a blast playing games and chatting with her classmates online (Apparently I`m not the only one who could care less about age limits)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;I just checked on her page for the 15th time today and see she has added &quot;Devout Atheist&quot; boldly displayed on her profile page.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Sigh&amp;gt;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;My atheism has caused many problems for my daughter most of which revolve around the fact that all my neighbors were very freindly and she played with the numerous kids in the neighborhood up and until my Devout Christian neighbors discovered my atheism.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Now she`s a leper and none of the kids in the neighborhood are allowed to play with her because she is of course satans child and will lead their kids into the very depths of hell.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Now her classmates parents will undoubtedly see that she`s a &quot;devout atheist&quot; and I fear the same ostracization will occur.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;My wife wants it removed from her page.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;I don`t want to give her any reason to believe there is shame in what she thinks she believes/disbelieves (I realize she`s 11 and may very well be a baptist preacher by the time she`s 22 but for now she claims atheism undoubtedly due to my beliefs)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;You have to understand this kid isn`t your average 11 year old and neither are her classmates they`re all gifted with 130 or above IQ`s and in special classes running special critical thinking competitions and the whole parent/teacher/student/ situation in this class is very tight knit.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Most of them could perform well at high school levels in many areas.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;She`s adamant she won`t remove it and I`m at a loss as I`ve always told her she should never be ashamed of whatever she believes about anything.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;I`ve informed her she runs the risk of being ostracized in the same manner she was in our neighborhood and she just doesn`t give a damn.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;She says that if they can`t accept her for what she is she doesn`t want their acceptance.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;This of course fills me with so much pride I could burst but I really don`t want her tight knit &quot;family&quot; that the class has become over the past few years to shun her as it would truly hurt her.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;I`m not worried about the kids reactions as truthfully most of them are smarter than their parents but I`m worried about what the parents might do or make their kids do.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;She did the right thing...&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;It's just the consequences that aren't fair.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;She did fine; if she wanted to be a devout atheist (remember DEVOUT) she should stick up for that, just like people do when they are devout liberals or devout conservatives.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;And never get ashamed at herself for that, be ashamed at the neighbors who ignorantly shame her for being in another religion that has not harmed them.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Premium Member&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;No, she did the juvenile thing which, in her case, is reasonable.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;23&quot;&gt;It's sad nevertheless.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;In my opinion ...&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;I'm not trying to argue the validity of either position in this thread.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;I'm simply trying to present the Christian argument as clear as possible.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Understand that most Christian parents do not want their kids around people who could potentially lead their kids away from what they believe is the truth.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Because they believe that=hell.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;It's not out of hatred that they try to keep a safe distance from you and your family, it's out of fear.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;Most of these Christian parents probably wouldn't want their kids hanging out with any children other than other Christian children.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;37&quot;&gt;If you were Muslim or Jewish you'd probably be dealing with the same situation.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;38&quot;&gt;For your kid to really be considered acceptable as a playmate for the Christian children she'd probably have to lie and call herself a Christian.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;39&quot;&gt;She might be able to sneak in by calling herself a theist (being very ambiguous about the specific type of theism).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;My attitude is that we as 21st century Westerners spoil our kids.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;In the Middle Ages, kids that were 8 years old would be working full time and they'd get married at 12.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;42&quot;&gt;There's was a very harsh world yet they persevered.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;43&quot;&gt;IMO, you should let your daughter be welcomed into the real world.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Better that than live a lie.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;45&quot;&gt;What kind of a lesson will it teach your daughter to lie about who she is in order to be welcomed.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;46&quot;&gt;I've never been a parent but I am someone who's had their teeth kicked in on a constant basis since my earliest days.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;47&quot;&gt;If you knew more about my life I guarantee you wouldn't challenge that claim.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;48&quot;&gt;It's time to be a warrior I say.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Most are unaware of religious scholarship and incapable of evaluating its worth.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Their 'atheism' is necessarily shallow.....&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;55&quot;&gt;I agree which is why I mentioned she could be a baptist by 22 but damn she`s headstrong.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;56&quot;&gt;Considering her path so far she does indeed fall victim to the seduction you speak of.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;57&quot;&gt;I don`t think there`s anyway to get her past that other than letting her take the lumps that comes along with it until she learns.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&#8203;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;59&quot;&gt;&#8203;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;60&quot;&gt;... and I bet she'll turn out great.&lt;/s&gt;
