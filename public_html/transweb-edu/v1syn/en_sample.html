&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Session 40 - The Interstellar Medium.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Display session, Tuesday, June 09&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size shells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;This differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Evidence for giant shells with energies of \sim10^53 ergs are summarized.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be GRB remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;The expected frequency of GRBs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;A land whose rich cultural heritage is discovered not only from within the walls of numerous museums, galleries and churches, many of which today, as zero category monuments are included in a part of the UNESCO World Heritage List, but also in that magical place on the Mediterranean, where even the shortest stroll becomes a journey down a staircase thousands of years old, which takes one through a history that is at the same time turbulent, exciting and glorious.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;With as many as seven cultural phenomena- The Festivity of Saint Blaise, lace-making in Lepoglava, Hvar and Pag, the bell ringers from the Kastav region, the Hvar Procession Za Kri&#382;em, (&lsquo;following the Cross&rsquo;), two-part singing in the Istrian scale, in Istria and Hrvatsko Primorje, the spring procession of &lsquo;Ljelje&rsquo; and traditional manufacture of wooden toys in the Hrvatsko zagorje region, Croatia is among the countries with the most protected intangible cultural heritage elements, recorded on the UNESCO List.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;The famous scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), inventor of alternating current.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Was born in Smiljan, Croatia, died in New York, USA.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Dog breed Dalmatian originates from these areas?&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;In a small Franciscan monastery in Zaostrog, there is a painting from 1724 which for the first time depicts a Dalmatian dog&hellip;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Slavoljub Eduard Penkala&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;In 1906, a Croat Slavoljub Eduard Penkala for the first time applied for a patent for a ballpoint (penkala) and a holder for a fountain pen.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;From time immemorial, the tie has been a part of the Croatian national costume, which was preserved by the Croats to the more recent times, who moved to central Europe in the 16th century.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Under the leadership of the French &bdquo;God of Sun&quot; Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The word &laquo;kravata&raquo; (tie) originates from the word &laquo;Kroate&raquo;...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;The world traveler and explorer Marco Polo was born in 1254, most probably on the island of Kor&#269;ula.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Even today, there are people living on the island with the same last name..&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Island of Vrnik is situated in the archipelago of the Pelje&scaron;ac canal in front of the east coast of Kor&#269;ula island, widely known for its stone-pit of quality lime-stone (marble) from which Aia Sofia (Istanbul) and the While House (Washington) were partly built as were some palaces-town halls in Dubrovnik, Stockholm, Venice, Vienna.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Visit to the fertile plains of Baranja where the grapes have been cultivated for centuries, is not complete if you do not taste the &quot;golden drops&quot; of Baranja's vineyards.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;According to the old manuscripts, vine was a usual drink at the royal court of Maria Teresa, and the ancient Romans, delighted with its bouquet and with the sun rises and sunsets of that region, called it the &quot;Golden hill&quot;...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;There is a Ulysses' cave on the island of Mljet.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;It was named after a story which says that a famous adventurer stranded on the nearby cliff Ogiron, where he met the nymph Calypso with whom he fell in love, and spent unforgettable moments in her company...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Red-white coat of arms&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Recognizable all over the world, and related only to Croats - characteristic cube-shaped red-white coat of arms which is believed to originate from the Persian original homeland of Croats (red signifies south and white signifies north).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;23&quot;&gt;That is where the name for two Croatias derives from, i.e.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;24&quot;&gt;White in north and Red in south.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;25&quot;&gt;When the Croats have selected Ferdinand Habsburg to be their King in Cetine in 1527, they confirmed that choice with some seals, and one of them was Croatian coat of arms, but with 64 fields, i.e. the complete chess-board.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;26&quot;&gt;That is where the popular term &bdquo;&scaron;ahovnica&quot; derives from, and &Scaron;ah (chess) in Persian means the Ruler - Tsar.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Did you know that there is a world rarity in the Archeological museum in Zagreb?&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Of course, we are talking about the Zagreb mummy.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Nesi-hensu, the wife of Aher-hensu, &bdquo;the divine tailor&quot; from Thebes, is the name of a mummified woman who was wrapped in cut ribbons of Zagreb linen book which represents the longest preserved text in Etruscan language and the only preserved sample of linen book in the entire Ancient world.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Top seven world getaways&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The American magazine &quot;In Style&quot; has included Croatia on its list of seven top world destinations (&quot;Top seven world getaways&quot;).&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;The article authors recommend a visit to Croatia for its very rich historical-cultural heritage, natural beauties and clean sea.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;In addition to Croatia, the list of top seven places includes Kenya, South Africa, London, Greek island Santorini and three American destinations - Aspen, Napa Valley and Nantucket.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Every day, for over hundred and ten years, the cannon fires from the top of tower Lotr&scaron;&#269;ak exactly at noon in memory of an event from Zagreb history.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;According to the legend, exactly at noon, the Gri&#269; canon fired a discharge from Lotr&scaron;&#269;ak to the Turkish camp located across Sava and blew out a rooster (or a turkey) which the cook was taking to Pasha on a platter.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;After this event, the Turks scattered and did not attack Zagreb...&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Average life span in the wild: 12 years&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Size: 21 in (50 cm)&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Did you know?&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Chameleons don't change colors to match their surroundings.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Each species displays distinct color patterns to indicate specific reactions or emotions.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;The Meller's chameleon is the largest of the chameleons not native to Madagascar.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Their stout bodies can grow to be up to two feet (two-thirds of a meter) long and weigh more than a pound (one-half kilogram).&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Meller's distinguish themselves from their universally bizarre-looking cousins with a single small horn protruding from the front of their snouts.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;This and their size earn them the common name &quot;giant one-horned chameleon.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;They are fairly common in the savanna of East Africa, including Malawi, northern Mozambique, and Tanzania.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Almost one-half of the world&rsquo;s chameleons live on the island of Madagascar.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;As with all chameleons, Meller's will change colors in response to stress and to communicate with other chameleons.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Their normal appearance is deep green with yellow stripes and random black spots.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Females are slightly smaller, but are otherwise indistinguishable from males.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;They subsist on insects and small birds, using their camouflage and a lightning-fast, catapulting tongue, which can be up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) long, to ambush prey.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Exotic pet enthusiasts often attempt to keep Meller's chameleons as pets.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;However, they are highly susceptible to even the slightest level of stress and are very difficult to care for in captivity.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;In the wild, they can live as long as 12 years.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Nuclear Energy in France&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Nuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;In the &lsquo;70s France chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Nuclear Electricity Production: France currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80% of French domestic electricity.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;As a comparison, the 104 US reactors produces 20% of US electricity.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Despite scarce natural resources, France has reached an energy independence of 50% thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Environment: As well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the OECD.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;As a leader in nuclear energy, France has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Reprocessing currently allows France to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;French nuclear power plants produces only 10 g/year/inhabitant of highly radioactive waste.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;International Cooperation and research: France is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the United States such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants (Gen IV) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that will be built in Cadarache, South of France.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The French Atomic Energy Commission is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;It constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA is involved in three main fields:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;It develops and acquires the technological building blocks necessary to the development of the nuclear reactors of the future (Contribution to Generation IV and GNEP research),&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;It contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission with its research on hydrogen, fuel cells, biomass, energy storage&hellip;,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;It supports the nuclear utilities in France by optimizing the nuclear power plants of the French nuclear fleet and by optimizing the fuel cycle,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;It offers safe and economically viable technical solutions for managing nuclear waste,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;It conducts fundamental research in climate and environmental sciences, high energy physics, astrophysics, fusion, nanosciences&hellip;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Information and Health technologies:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;22&quot;&gt;It tackles micro and nano-technologies for telecommunication and nuclear medicine for radiotherapy and medical imaging,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;23&quot;&gt;It researches programs on biotechnology, molecular labelling, biomolecular engineering and structural biology,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;24&quot;&gt;It shares its knowledge and know-how through education and training through the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTN),&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;25&quot;&gt;It manages over 300 priority patents and is active in the creation of clusters.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;26&quot;&gt;Defense and National Security:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;27&quot;&gt;It conceives, builds, maintains then dismantles the nuclear warhead of the French deterrence force,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;It helps to fight against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons (NRBC program).&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;29&quot;&gt;The missions of the CEA are similar to the Department of Energy in the United States.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;30&quot;&gt;The CEA has a network of counselor or representatives in French Embassies around the world (see joint map).&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Created in 2006, from the former DSIN (Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear Facilities), the French Nuclear Safety Authority is an independent administrative authority which is tasked with regulating nuclear safety and radiation protection in order to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks involved in nuclear activities.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;33&quot;&gt;It also contributes to informing the public.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, it carries out inspections and may pronounce sanctions, up to and including suspension of operation of an installation.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;35&quot;&gt;French Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;36&quot;&gt;Created in 2001 by merging the Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IPSN) and the Ionizing radiations Protection Office (OPRI), the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature placed under the joint authority of the Ministries of the Environment, Health, Industry, Research and Defense.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;37&quot;&gt;It is the expert in safety research and specialized assessments into nuclear and radiological risk serving public authorities whose work is complementary to the ASN.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Its scope of activities includes:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;39&quot;&gt;environment and response, human radiological protection, research on the prevention of major accidents, power reactor safety, fuel cycle facility safety, research installation safety, waste management safety; nuclear defense expertise.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;40&quot;&gt;National radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Created in 1991, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management is a public industrial and commercial organization that operates independently of waste producers.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;42&quot;&gt;It is responsible for the long-term management of radioactive waste produced in France under the supervision of the French Ministries for Energy, Research and the Environment.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;43&quot;&gt;It can be compared to a certain extent to the Office for Nuclear Waste of the Department of Energy in the United States.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Andra also pursues industrial, research, and information activities as it designs and implements disposal solutions suited to each category of radioactive waste:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;45&quot;&gt;the collection, conditioning, disposal of radioactive waste from small producers (hospitals, research centers, industry), specification of waste packages for disposal, disposal in suited sites, monitoring of closed disposal facilities, research programs for long-lived and high level activity waste, especially through the operation of an underground research laboratory in a deep clay formation&hellip;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;46&quot;&gt;General Directorate for Energy and Climate (DGEC)&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;47&quot;&gt;The General Directorate for Energy and Climate represents the government and is part of the Office of the Department for Ecology and Sustainable Development.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;48&quot;&gt;It defines the French nuclear policy.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;49&quot;&gt;The DGEC takes care of the energy supply, the security of supply, oil refining and logistics, nuclear industry, and coal and mines.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Consequently, its activities include:&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;51&quot;&gt;the design and implement energy and raw material supply policy, to ensure opening of electricity and gas markets, track key energy and raw material sectors, to oversee enterprises and public institutions in energy sector, to ensure compliance with rules and regulations governing energy sector, to participate in European and international energy projects and working groups, to provide economic, environmental, and fiscal expertise on energy matters.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The vaunted protection that intellectually active adults get from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease has a dark downside, a study released Wednesday has found.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Once dementia symptoms become evident and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is diagnosed in such patients, their mental decline can come with frightening speed.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;That finding, published in the journal Neurology, comes from a study of 1,157 Chicago-based seniors who were followed for an average of just over 11 years.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Six years after gauging the extent to which the study participants engaged in activities that challenged their mental capacities, researchers from Rush University Medical Center Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Center made periodic assessments of the study participants&rsquo; cognitive health and traced the trajectories of their brain health.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;All told, 148 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease during the follow-up period, and 395 were found to have mild cognitive impairment&mdash;intellectual problems that are less severe than Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, but which often precede such a diagnosis.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;While all participants&rsquo; mental function showed yearly declines, the steepest downward trajectories belonged to those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, but who had reported high levels of mental engagement at the outset of the study.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Fellow Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers who had not sought out much intellectual stimulation at the study&rsquo;s outset showed a more gradual decline in their function.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&ldquo;In effect, the results of this study suggest that the benefit of delaying the initial appearance of cognitive impairment [in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease] comes at the cost of more rapid dementia progression,&rdquo; the author wrote.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;The findings support a common observation of those who treat intellectually minded patients who go on to be diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&mdash;that once diagnosed, their decline is rapid.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;It also underscores a growing body of evidence that the bright and mentally-active may not beat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, but can hold off its ravages for months or years longer than those who are not so engaged.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Dr.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;John M.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Ringman, a UCLA neurologist and assistant director of the Mary S.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Easton Center for Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Research, said he sees regular evidence of the phenomenonen in his clinical work, as well as in brain-imaging scans that can detect the physical signs of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease while a patient is still alive: Patients with a history of intensive mental engagement seem to develop a &ldquo;cognitive reserve,&rdquo; said Dr.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Ringman.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;That mental strength frequently allows them to function almost normally, he said, even as the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks of the disease have advanced upon the brain.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;17&quot;&gt;By the time such a patient comes to his office complaining that his memory and mental function are not what they used to be, the disease has progressed significantly, said Ringman.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;The decline from that point can be precipitous.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s id=&quot;19&quot;&gt;In a disease that evidence now suggests takes years, perhaps decades, to show up in everyday behavior, Ringman said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to quantify this cognitive reserve.&rdquo;&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;20&quot;&gt;The strength of the study published Wednesday is that it gathered copious evidence of participants&rsquo; mental status and activity at the outset and followed them for more than a decade, he added.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen&rsquo;s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.&lt;/s&gt;
